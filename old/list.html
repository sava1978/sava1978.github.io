            <p>Over the years, as my skills and tastes improved, this website had a number of redesigns. Three redesigns, in fact.</p>
            <p>Although not all of them are in English and some stuff in them is pretty cringe, I've decided not to hide my past and to keep them here.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="window">
            <a href="ver1/index.html" target="_blank"><h2>The first version</h2></a>
            <a href="ver1/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/old1.png" width="50%"></a>
            <p>I made it sometime in the end of 2020, because i saw that a domain with the butchered version of my name was for sale. I bought it for around 3-4$ and made a quick shitty website in notepad. Then I built it up and up, until it became a cringy unmaintainable mess of code (I didn't even use CSS files and just wrote everything in the same HTML file).</p>
            <p>I also put everything I was proud of making on there. Including my shitty streams, stolen projects, racist spam bots and a site that I made just to harass my classmate. Suffice to say, I was a pretty terrible kid.</p>

        <div id="window">
            <a href="ver2/index.html" target="_blank"><h2>The second version</h2></a>
            <a href="ver2/index.html" target="_blank"><img src="images/old2.png" width="50%"></a>
            <p>I made this version in the end of June 2023. I was bored out of my mind and stuck at home (all my friends left for the summer) and decided to finally make myself a new website, that I could show to people. I am still pretty proud of this one, but IMHO it lacked some originality, as it used a pretty popular sadgrl's layout and the standart background for it.</p>
