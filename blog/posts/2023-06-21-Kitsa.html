      <p>I went to Kitsa on the 10th of June to meet some friends and take pictures, but once again I was convinced that art markets are not for me.
        Loud shitty pop music from the speakers, lots of genshin, lots of cosplays of characters I don't know, lots of people, lots of genshin, lots of little girls, LOTS OF GENSHIN. Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying it's all bad, of course. It's just not for me.
        The most interesting sight for me at Kitsa was the parents who were dragged there by their children. Those incredible faces full of bewilderment, disgust, amazement, and total fucked upness I will never forget (unfortunately, I was afraid to capture their beautiful faces, so please take their word for it).
        Anyway, Kitsa is great if you want to go to an art market, but you don't have the money (although if you don't have the money, whu would you even go to an art market at all...), but it's not my format.</p>
