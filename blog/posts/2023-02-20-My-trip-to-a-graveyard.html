      <p>This is my friend <a href="https://vk.com/pglpictures">Nikita</a>. He is a very talented movie director, with which I had the pleasure to work. Yesterday, we went to a graveyard far out of the city to film something for a documentary that he was making. We almost died that day. It was incredibly cold, dark and hard to film. Also, we got lost in the woods.</p>
