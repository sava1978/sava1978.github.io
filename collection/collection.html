            <p>Man, this must be the most beautiful website I have ever seen. Everything is perfect there. The music, the visuals, the uncountable amount of easter eggs, the ASCII art - everything is just incredible.<br>Please check it out, I beg you.<br>Just keep in mind - it's closed on Mondays :)</p>

            <p>It's a site for a webcomic! Although I haven't read the actual comic, the art looks very cool. I have a friend IRL, who is a HUGE fan of it! You can see the dedication that the author has for his work. He even made shimejis for his characters!</p>

            <a href="https://gifypet.neocities.org/" target="_blank"><img src="images/gifypet.png"></a>
            <p>A very cool website that allow you to create a virtual pet on your website. It's like a Tamagotchi, but way cooler! It's also from the same guy, that created melonking.net. BTW I have hidden my own GIFYPET on my own website. Good luck finding it ;)</p>

            <a href="https://sadgrl.online/" target="_blank"><img src="images/sadgrl.png" width="50%"></a>
            <p>I would have never made my website without sadgrl.<br>I am not exaggerating.<br>She has the most useful tool, website and cool stuff collection I've ever seen. She also made the template, on which the second version of my site was buit.<br>If you plan to make your own webpage, this one is a must-visit.</p>

            <p>Another webpage from MelonKing! This one is also amazing. It's like a retro 3D world entirely within your browser. It says that it's multiplayer, but it's not - it's just an imitation. Anyway, it's cool AF!</p>
